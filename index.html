        <h2>Journal about “3 most dangerous threats to your computer “<br>
        Dated: 11/24/20 <br>
        By: Syed S.Ali</h2> <br>
        <h4>There are so many ways that’s you can put your computer in danger, to prevent those threats
        you need to be very careful what you are doing on your computer and you need to make sure
        that you got the right tools to protect your computer, out of all those threats there are three
        most dangerous threats to your computer. <br>
        <br>
        1) Computer Virus: <br>

        Most well-known security threat to a PC is computer viruses, a computer
        virus is a malicious software program loaded onto a user’s computer without the user’s
        knowledge and performs malicious actions. <br>

        Computer virus is just like a virus that makes human sick, to get ride of that we have to find out,
        what kind of virus we got, so we can take the right medication to kill that virus and feel healthy. <br>
        same way if your computer gets contaminated by virus, you need to find out and eliminate that
        virus ASAP, computer viruses never occurred naturally, they always induced by humans, Once
        created and released, however, their diffusion is not directly under human control. After
        entering a computer, a virus attaches itself to another program in such a way that execution of
        the host program triggers the action of the virus simultaneously. It can self-replicate, inserting
        itself onto other programs or files, infecting them in the process. <br>
        <br>
        How to prevent Virus: <br>

        To prevent virus and keep your computer healthy, you need
        a 24 hours security guard, who is watching your computer transactions who is entering
        and who is leaving, that guard called antivirus software I would highly recommend
        buying a good antivirus software to protect your computer. <br>
        <br>

        2) Phishing: <br>

        Masquerading as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal
        sensitive financial or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages.
        Phishing attacks are some of the most successful methods for cybercriminals looking to pull off
        a data breach. <br>
        The information they steal from you used to access important accounts and can result in
        identity theft and financial loss. <br>
        How to prevent Phishing: <br>

        Now a days it’s easy to recognize the cybercriminals than it
        was 10 years ago with all internet help you can identify those thieves; you just have to be very
        careful with your personal data. <br>
        <br>
        1. When it’s too good to be true it’s not true at all. <br>
        2. Sense of urgency don’t rush or don’t get scared of their false and empty threats. <br>
        3. DO NOT open any unknown email especially with free materials subject or don’t click to
        any random email or don’t click on any unusual attachments. <br>
        <br>

        3) DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): <br>

        Overwhelming hosted servers and causing them
        to become completely inoperable is the task of a cyber-attack known as a Distributed Denial of
        Service (DDoS) attack. According to statistics, 33% of business fall victim to DDoS attacks. DDoS
        attacks can be disastrous for companies that make their money operating online (social media,
        e-commerce sites, etc.), potentially causing millions of dollars in lost revenue every day the
        website is down. <br>
        It’s likely that not all of the potentially thousands of computers being used for a DDoS attack
        actually belong to the attacker. Instead, we can assume that most of the compromised
        computers are added to the attacker’s network by malware and distributed across the globe via
        a botnet.</h4>

            In the simplest sense, networking means connecting
            computers so that they can share files, printers,
            applications, and other computer-related resources.
            and other devices connected in some ways so as
            to be able to exchange data.

        <th>
            Why is networking important? Networking allows you
            access to opportunities you might not be able to
            find on your own. Your network has the potential to
            provide you with insight into different fields,
            information on what potential employers look for and
            advice on how you can improve professionally.

        </th>

        <th>
            An example of networking is sharing and acquiring
            information between different divisions of the same
            company to share information and solve business problems.
            An example of networking is linking the entire
            network of computers to a print server to allow each
            workstation to have the ability to print documents.

            A network protocol is an established set of rules
            that determine how data is transmitted between different
            devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows
            connected devices to communicate with each other,
            regardless of any differences in their internal processes,
            structure or design. Network protocols are the
            reason you can easily communicate with people all over the
            world, and thus play a critical role in modern
            digital communications.
        </th>

        <th>
            Communication protocols allow different network devices
            to communicate with each other. They are used in both
            analog and digital communications and can be used for
            important processes, ranging from transferring
            files between devices to accessing the internet.

        <th>
            A protocol is a standard set of rules that allow electronic

            commands are used to send and receive data, and how
            data transfers are confirmed.

            Most network protocol suites are structured as a series
            of layers, sometimes referred to collectively as a
            protocol stack. Each layer is designed for a specific
            purpose. Each layer exists on both the sending and
            receiving hosts. ... Effectively, each layer on a host
            acts independently of other layers on the same
            machine.
        </th>

        <th>
            Protocol Layers. The communication between the nodes
            in a packet data network must be precisely defined to
            ensure correct interpretation of the packets by the
            receiving intermediate and the end systems. ... The
            protocols are usually structured together to form a
            layered design (also known as a "protocol stack").

        </th>

        <th>
            For example, two instances of TCP talk with each other
            by exchanging IP packets. A correct TCP implementation
            should never interact directly with the device driver
            for the Ethernet card. The chunks of information exchanged
            are called protocol data units.

            based on different protocols Requires the definition
            of a common interconnection protocol on top
            the local protocols.The Internet Protocol (IP) plays

            Interconnection is important both as a consumer issue
